# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
This repository primarily contains work I've completed during my Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree program.

My preparation for a future as a data analyst comes from the online data analyst curriculum at Udacity, which teaches me how to clean and organize data, spot patterns and insights, make meaningful inferences, and effectively convey important findings. As I construct a portfolio of projects, I am becoming more proficient in SQL, Python, and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib).

Installing numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn thest basic libraries is advised for data research applications using Python.
